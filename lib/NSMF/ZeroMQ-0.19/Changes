  - Make header, incpath, lib detection smarter. 
    * Now supports pkg-config!
    * Environment variables ZMQ_HOME, ZMQ_INCLUDES, ZMQ_LIBS are
      honored. Please see POD for how to configure ZeroMQ.pm

0.10 Wed Apr 13 2011 10:30 JST
  - Use Module::Instsall::CheckLib
  - Silence test failures [https://github.com/lestrrat/ZeroMQ-Perl/issues/11]
    (reported by oyvindsk)

0.09_01 Fri Mar 11 2011 08:00 JST
  - Add ZeroMQ::Poller (https://github.com/lestrrat/ZeroMQ-Perl/pull/8)

0.09 Wed Feb 16 2011 22:30 JST
  - Only run silly Module::Install hoopla if you're an author
  - Tweak Makefile.PL
  - Smarter zmq.h detection
  - Include Devel::CheckLib in requires

0.08 Sun Jan 23 2011 14:45 JST
  - Fixed many memory leaks (rt #64944) reported by Jason Ball
    * Plugged ZeroMQ::Raw::Message related leaks 
    * Plugged leaks when setting $!
    * Wrote tests using zmq_poll() and AnyEvent to do non-blocking
      recv() with zeromq
  - Backwards incompatible change! zmq_send() now returns exactly what
    the underlying zeromq library returns -- previously it used to
    return a "true" value for success and false otherwise.

0.07 Tue Jan 18 2011 07:50 JST
  - Somehow zmq_device() was missing through 0.03 to 0.06. Re-added
    as ZeroMQ::Raw::zmq_device()

0.06 Tue Jan 18 2011 07:20 JST
  - Fix critical message corruption bug introduced by wrong usage of
    zmq_msg_init_data() (rt #64836). Reported, diagnosed by Jason Ball

0.05 Thu Jan 06 2011 19:20 JST
  - Various issues (rt #64520) reported by Jason Ball
    * Make sure to generate const-xs.inc and the like when installing
    * Tweak to work with perls older than 5.10
    * Only generate README for authors

0.04 Wed Jan 05 2011 18:20 JST
  - Grr, remove autobuild stuff from MANIFEST, repackage.
  - Code is identical to 0.03

0.03 Wed Jan 05 2011 15:00 JST
  - Ad docs, and upload 0.03

0.02_05 Tue Jan 03 2011 00:30 JST
  - Add zmq_poll, with the ability to poll random file descriptors along with
    zmq sockets (rt #62851)

0.02_04 Tue Dec 29 2010 16:20 JST
  - Add zmq_msg_copy and zmq_msg_move
  - Fix minor compile warning
  - Make it so that ZeroMQ::Raw doesn't depend on ZeroMQ -- and other
    modules that it in turn depends on. Now ZeroMQ::Raw can be used standalone

0.02_03 Tue Dec 28 2010 21:40 JST
  - Rework the internals to allow high level API (perl-ish, OO) and
    low level API (straight portof zeromq C binding), thanks to jrockway
  - Remove PollItem in favor of getsockopt + ZMQ_FD. Holler if you need it back

0.02_02 Sat Oct 30 2010 21:20 JST
  - Update to work with zeromq2 master (as of 10/28)
  - Added new constants
  - ZMQ_POLLIN callbacks used to pass the ZeroMQ::Message argument
    to the callback function, but this is error prone, so now the callback
    does not receive anything

0.02_01 Mon Sep 06 2010 19:20 JST
  - Releasing a dev release to get some test coverage
  - Add zmq_poll support via ZeroMQ::PollItem
  - Lots of doc fixes
  - Lots of test fixes
  - For people cloning from github, tell them what Module::Install
    modules you need to install
  - Loudly tell the user that you're going to get a blocking socket
    even if you send a SIGINT/SIGTERM while it's in recv().
    This is a problem in libzmq, and it is planned to be fixed on
    libzmq 2.1.x

0.02  Sat Aug 22 2010 09:00 JST
  - Changes from 0.01_01 to 0.02 were tested against zeromq-2.0.7
  - Implement version()
  - Be more paranoid about getting an invalid object (with a
    bad struct)
  - House cleaning, and release a new version!

0.01_03  Thu Aug 20 2010 21:00 JST
  - Fake ZMQ_PULL and ZMQ_PUSH, which were introduced in git, but not in
    the released version
  - Use assert_lib() to die if zmq is not found
  - Implement socket close()

0.01_02  Thu Aug 20 2010 08:00 JST
  - No code change.
  - Add missing xs/const-xs.inc file
  - Add POD tests (author tests)

0.01_01  Thu Aug 19 2010 20:00 JST
  - Daisuke Maki (lestrrat) hacked the following:
    * Use plain XS -- only because I don't know C++
    * Implemented serialization/deserialization
    * Worked on more thread safety
    * Updated constants
    * Implemented $ctxt->socket
    * Implemented $socket->send($plain_string)
    * Implemented ZeroMQ::device() 
    * Implemented example scripts from http://zeromq.org/docs:introduction
      under eg/

  - Initial release
